      "Bash(echo \"# Feature Specification: AI-Native Book with Docusaurus\n\n**Feature Branch**: 001-ai-book-docusaurus\n**Created**: 2025-12-16\n**Status**: Draft\n**Input**: User description: Create book-first technical specifications for an AI-Native book built with Docusaurus. Focus on: Docusaurus site structure, MDX content organization, and book-like UI design; Lightweight, optional Ask the Book RAG feature that answers only from book content and remains invisible during normal reading; Static-first architecture with minimal backend support (FastAPI + Qdrant + Neon) used only for optional intelligence; No user authentication, dashboards, forms, or platform-style workflows; Optional Urdu translation and summaries as reading aids, not configurable features; Performance, simplicity, and reader-centric experience as primary constraints. All specifications must strictly follow the Book-First and Reader-Centric principles defined in the constitution.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Read Book Content (Priority: P1)\n\nAs a reader, I want to navigate through the book content in a structured, book-like interface that provides a smooth reading experience with proper chapter organization, search functionality, and responsive design.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without a readable book interface, the entire product fails to deliver value. This forms the foundation for all other features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the book content and navigating through chapters, sections, and pages. Delivers the primary value of providing access to the book content in an organized, readable format.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user accesses the book site, **When** they browse the table of contents, **Then** they can see all chapters organized in a clear, book-like structure with proper hierarchy\n2. **Given** a user is reading a chapter, **When** they navigate to the next/previous section, **Then** the content loads quickly and maintains their reading position\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Search Book Content (Priority: P1)\n\nAs a reader, I want to search for specific content within the book to quickly find relevant information without having to manually browse through all chapters.\n\n**Why this priority**: Search functionality is essential for book usability - readers need to find specific topics quickly, which is a core expectation of any book-like interface.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering search queries and verifying that relevant book content is returned. Delivers value by enabling efficient information discovery within the book.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user enters search terms, **When** they submit the search, **Then** they see relevant book content sections ranked by relevance\n2. **Given** a user performs a search, **When** no results are found, **Then** they receive a clear message indicating no matches were found\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Use AI Assistant to Answer Questions (Priority: P2)\n\nAs a reader, I want to ask questions about the book content and receive accurate answers based only on the book''s content, without this feature interfering with my normal reading experience.\n\n**Why this priority**: This adds intelligent value to the book experience, but is secondary to basic reading functionality. The feature should be optional and non-intrusive.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking questions about book content and verifying that answers are accurate and sourced only from the book. Delivers value by providing an intelligent assistant that enhances understanding.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user asks a question about book content, **When** they submit the query, **Then** they receive an answer sourced only from the book content with proper attribution\n2. **Given** a user is reading normally, **When** they do not engage with the AI feature, **Then** the AI functionality remains invisible and does not impact reading performance\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Access Urdu Translation and Summaries (Priority: P3)\n\nAs a reader who prefers Urdu, I want to access translations and summaries of book content to enhance my understanding and reading experience.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is an accessibility enhancement that broadens the book''s reach, but is not essential for the core reading experience.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching to Urdu translations and verifying content accuracy. Delivers value by making the book accessible to Urdu-speaking readers.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user selects Urdu language option, **When** they view book content, **Then** they see translated content alongside or instead of original content\n2. **Given** a user accesses summary features, **When** they view a section, **Then** they can see optional summaries that enhance understanding\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the AI feature is unavailable or the backend service is down? The reading experience should continue normally without the AI feature.\n- How does the system handle very large search queries or complex questions? The system should provide appropriate error messages or limits.\n- What if the Urdu translation is not available for certain sections? The system should fall back to the original language with clear indication.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a book-like UI with clear chapter/section hierarchy and navigation controls\n- **FR-002**: System MUST organize content using MDX format for rich, interactive documentation\n- **FR-003**: System MUST render static content efficiently with fast load times\n- **FR-004**: System MUST provide full-text search functionality across all book content\n- **FR-005**: System MUST offer optional AI-powered question answering that sources responses only from book content\n- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure the AI feature remains invisible during normal reading unless explicitly activated\n- **FR-007**: System MUST support optional Urdu translations and summaries as reading aids\n- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain responsive design across all device sizes\n- **FR-009**: System MUST provide proper accessibility features for readers with disabilities\n- **FR-010**: System MUST cache static content effectively to minimize load times\n- **FR-011**: System MUST provide proper SEO capabilities for book content discoverability\n- **FR-012**: System MUST allow content authors to easily update and maintain book content using MDX\n\n### Key Entities\n\n- **Book Content**: The primary content of the book organized in chapters and sections using MDX format, representing the core value proposition\n- **AI Knowledge Base**: The indexed version of book content used by the RAG system to answer questions, derived from book content\n- **Search Index**: The full-text search capability that enables users to find content within the book\n- **Translation Set**: Optional Urdu translations and summaries associated with book content sections\n- **User Session**: Temporary state to maintain reading position and preferences during a reading session (not persisted)\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can access and navigate through book content with page load times under 2 seconds for 95% of requests\n- **SC-002**: Users can find relevant content through search functionality within 3 seconds of query submission\n- **SC-003**: 90% of users can successfully navigate between chapters and sections without encountering broken links or missing content\n- **SC-004**: AI-powered answers are provided within 5 seconds and are sourced only from the book content with 95% accuracy\n- **SC-005**: The AI feature remains invisible during normal reading, with less than 1% of users reporting performance degradation during regular reading\n- **SC-006**: Urdu translations are available for at least 80% of book content in the target language\n- **SC-007**: Users can complete the primary reading task (accessing any chapter and reading it) with 95% success rate\n- **SC-008**: The system maintains 99% uptime for static content delivery\")",
