# Preface

Welcome to the AI-Native Book, where we explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and how it relates to human intelligence. This book takes a unique approach by examining intelligence through the lens of perception, reasoning, and action.

The content in this book is designed to provide deep insights into both human and artificial intelligence, comparing and contrasting the mechanisms that drive intelligent behavior. Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a cohesive understanding of intelligence as a whole.
