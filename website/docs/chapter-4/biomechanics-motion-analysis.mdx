# Biomechanics and Human Motion Analysis for Humanoids: Understanding Human Movement for Robotic Replication

Humanoid robotics relies heavily on understanding human biomechanics and motion patterns to create robots that can move, interact, and function in human-designed environments. This chapter explores the fundamental principles of human biomechanics and how they inform the design and control of humanoid robots.
