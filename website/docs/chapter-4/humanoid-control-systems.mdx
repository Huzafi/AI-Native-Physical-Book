# Humanoid Control Systems and Algorithms: Advanced Control for Human-Like Movement and Behavior

Controlling humanoid robots presents unique challenges due to their complex kinematics, underactuation, and need for stable, human-like behavior. This chapter explores the sophisticated control systems and algorithms that enable humanoid robots to move, balance, and interact in human-like ways.

## Challenges in Humanoid Control

Humanoid control systems must address several unique challenges:
